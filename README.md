inductive.js
============

This is my attempt at a library which autogenerates working code from a battery of unit tests.

Example:

    specify('myFunc',
      given(2, shouldReturn(4)),
      given(3, shouldReturn(9)),
      use('*'));

    /* This code is autogenerated:
    function myFunc(arg0) {
      return (arg0 * arg0)
    }
    */

If we change the spec:

    specify('myFunc',
      given(2, shouldReturn(8)),  // 4 changed to 8
      given(3, shouldReturn(27)), // 9 changed to 27
      use('*'))

    /* This code is autogenerated:
    function myFunc(arg0) {
      return (arg0 * (arg0 * arg0))
    }
    */

Notice that as the unit tests change, the output automatically changes.

It works by doing a breadth-first, brute force search over correctly-typed abstract syntax trees and returns the first one that satisfies the unit tests.

You'll notice the `use` function.  The `use` function gives inductive.js building blocks to pull from when searching for a solution (the multiplication operator in this case).  Inductive.js combines this with the function's arguments to candidate programs to test.

Ideally, we wouldn't need a `use` function.  But the search space of all possible JavaScript programs is too large to be practical.

Still, even with this limitation, inductive.js can still be useful.

* We only need to write and maintain one version of the code, instead of having to simultaneously update code and tests whenever we make a change.

* Code generated by inductive.js is generally more reliable because you can't include code that isn't related to a test.

Inductive.js can handle non-toy problems as well.  For example, to program I/O like AJAX, you can use an API that resembles mocks.

Additionally, specifications are composable, so inductive.js can generate
programs of any size or complexity.

Quick Start
===========

First:

    npm install inductive.js

Then create a file called example.i.js:

    // Load the DSL:
    require('inductive.js').globals()

    // Specify our program:
    run(
      specify('helloWorld',
        givenNoArgs(
          mock('console.log',
            verify('hello world'))),
        use(
          'console.log',
          value('hello world'))))

    // Generate the .js file:
    saveAll()

Run the spec:

    node example.i.js

You can now run the auto-generated program:

    node example.js

Docs

Docs are forthcoming.  In the meantime, the `testSolves.i.js` file contains many examples.  The `buildingBlocks.js` file contains the default list of building blocks, which is also a list of examples of creating your own.
