inductive.js
============

This is my attempt at a library which autogenerates working code from a battery
of unit tests.

Example:

    specify('myFunc',
      given(2, shouldReturn(4)),
      given(3, shouldReturn(9)),
      use('*'));

    /* This code is autogenerated:
    function myFunc(arg0) {
      return (arg0 * arg0)
    }
    */

If we change the spec:

    specify('myFunc',
      given(2, shouldReturn(8)),  // 4 changed to 8
      given(3, shouldReturn(27)), // 9 changed to 27
      use('*'))

    /* This code is autogenerated:
    function myFunc(arg0) {
      return (arg0 * (arg0 * arg0))
    }
    */

Notice that as the unit tests change, the output automatically changes.

It works by doing a breadth-first, brute force search over correctly-typed
abstract syntax trees and returns the first one that satisfies the unit tests.

You'll notice the `use` function.  The `use` function gives inductive.js
building blocks to pull from when searching for a solution.  In this case we've
given it the multiplication operator.  Inductive.js combines this with the
function arguments to candidate programs to test.

Ideally, we wouldn't need a `use` function.  But the search space of all
possible JavaScript programs is too large to be practical.

Still, even with this limitation, it turns out inductive.js is pretty
useful.

* We only need to write and maintain one version of the code.  With
conventional unit testing frameworks, the code and the tests are two
versions of the same things, and whenever we change one we have to change the
other.

* Code generated by inductive.js is generally more reliable because you can't
include code that isn't related to a test.  With conventional testing
frameworks, it can be easy to add untested code paths to otherwise-tested
functions.

Inductive.js isn't limited to toy examples.  For example, it handles I/O
operations like AJAX by using API that resembles mocks from conventional
testing frameworks.

Additionally, specifications are composable, so inductive.js can generate
programs of any size or complexity.

Quick Start
===========

First:

    npm install inductive.js

Then create a file called example.i.js:

    // Load the DSL:
    require('inductive.js').globals()

    // Specify our program:
    run(
      specify('helloWorld',
        givenNoArgs(
          mock('console.log',
            verify('hello world'))),
        use(
          'console.log',
          value('hello world'))))

    // Generate the .js file:
    saveAll()

Run the spec:

    node example.i.js

You can now run the auto-generated program:

    node example.js

Docs

Docs are forthcoming.  In the meantime, the `testSolves.i.js` file contains 
many examples.  The `buildingBlocks.js` file contains the default list of
building blocks, which is also a list of examples of creating your own.
